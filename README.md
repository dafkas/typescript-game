# Pull request
Configured basic project. Configs where not okay to clone successfully. Removed Package.json and Webpack.config.js from Gitignore file. Made a new Webpack file to build the files & added package.json file so the node modules could be installed.

Because I couldnt get the project running on my laptop I couldnt add some OO principles. Wasted a lot of time on fixxing the project running on my laptop.

# Peer review
I'm making the peer review for Jurrian again, because where doing it with three, Joey gives me a review, I do Jurrian and Jurrian does Joey. 

I see al the OOP principles back in the game, except for the Observer pattern. I think that is because it was last week we had the lesson about the Observer.
